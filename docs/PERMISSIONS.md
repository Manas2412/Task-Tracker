# Permissions Matrix

> Division-wide by default: every non-PMU ministry officer sees all division-visibility tasks in each division they are a member of, from first login, regardless of hierarchy slot. A user's **member set** is their home division (`users.division_id`) plus any extra divisions a Super Admin has granted them via `user_division_access` (§5.18); in every member division the user is an ordinary member and sees that division's board. Special rules layer on top for PMU isolation, personal visibility, cross-division tasks, headed-division access (delegations), and OSD's unrestricted access. Enforcement lives in the data-access layer (`buildVisibilityClausesFrom` in src/lib/visibility-rules.ts) — every read filters by the caller's member set / PMU flag / headed divisions before returning rows. This document is the source of truth for what those helpers must implement.

## 1. Roles in the system

| Role | Hierarchy slot | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Joint Secretary | `js` | Top of the chain. Sees own tasks + the OSD-curated JS Priority Board |
| Officer on Special Duty | `osd` | Sees everything in the ministry. Toggles into Super Admin |
| Director | `director` | Sees full division (sub-divisions, sections, subordinates) |
| Deputy Secretary | `deputy_secretary` | Sees own chain |
| Under Secretary | `under_secretary` | Sees own chain |
| Section Officer | `section_officer` | Sees section + everyone under |
| Assistant Section Officer | `aso` | Sees own tasks; no subordinates by definition |
| PMU member | (any PMU role) | Sees only PMU-tagged tasks in their division |
| Super Admin | (overlay) | Same person as OSD initially; unrestricted access to any page |

Contract roles (PO / APO / YP) are visual overlays on a hierarchy slot. **Permissions follow the slot, not the contract role.**

## 2. Matrix — Tasks

Each row is a permission. Each column is a role acting on a task they can see (either by ownership, collaboration, hierarchy, or PMU collaboration).

¹ "Needs approval" = the request is created; the proposed new owner's superior must tap-approve before the reassignment takes effect.
² "partial" = only sees tasks owned by self or own subordinates that happen to be on the board, plus the visible-to-them JS Priority badge on every task they can already see. The full board is OSD + JS + Super Admin.

³ "head" = only when the user is that division's head (`divisions.head_user_id`) or holds an active `division_access_delegations` row for it — the hierarchy slot itself grants nothing. Giving tasks on a division's board is a head power; everyone else creates personal tasks (see §5.11).

⁴ PMU members see only their PMU team's division-visibility tasks (`ownerId IN <pmu team>`), never the full division board. See §5.2.

⁵ "member divisions" = the user's **home division** (`users.division_id`) plus any extra divisions a Super Admin has granted via `user_division_access`. The user sees the full division board of every division in this set and acts as an ordinary member there — the same rights they hold in their home division, but no head powers. See §5.18.

---

## 3. Matrix — Timeline Files

Timeline Files are visible only to divisions they are marked to, plus OSD/JS via the master view. An officer sees a Timeline File marked to **any** of their member divisions (home or admin-granted — §5.18): the scoper's `markedTo` clause unions the caller's full member set, so an extra membership widens Timeline-File sight the same way it widens task sight.

**Barred slots.** The **PMU Consultant** hierarchy slot (`consultant`) is excluded from the Timeline Files module entirely — it sees no Timeline File in any list, detail, count, calendar deadline, search result, or attachment, regardless of marked-to division, and the Timeline Files nav link is hidden for it. Enforced by `canAccessTimelineFiles` (`src/lib/timeline-files-access.ts`), which `buildTfVisibilityClause` checks first (a match-nothing clause that no role grant can widen); the linked-Timeline-File card on a task is gated by the same rule. Add more barred slots in `TIMELINE_FILES_HIDDEN_SLOTS`.

| | JS | OSD | Director of marked division | Other officers of marked division | Officers of unmarked divisions | PMU member of marked division | Super Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **See Timeline File** | ✓ (master) | ✓ (master) | ✓ | ✓ (per their chain) |  |  | ✓ |
| **Create Timeline File** |  | ✓ (or delegate) |  |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Edit subject / from / received date / deadline / marked-to** |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Change status** |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Add / edit Secretary's comments** |  | ✓ |  |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Upload source documents** |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Upload action document** |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (officer of section taking action) |  |  | ✓ |
| **Spawn task from Timeline File ("Create task from this file")** | head³ | ✓ | head³ | head³ |  |  | ✓ |
| **Forward to division / change marked-to** |  | ✓ |  |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Share link (read-only)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| **Hard-delete** |  |  |  |  |  |  | ✓ |

Timeline File status is **always manually set** — never auto-derived from linked task statuses.

## 4. Matrix — Super Admin Console

| Sub-section | OSD | Super Admin | Anyone else |
|---|---|---|---|
| Structure & hierarchy | (toggle into Super Admin) | ✓ |  |
| Users | (toggle into Super Admin) | ✓ |  |
| Tags & labels (Phase 3) | (toggle into Super Admin) | ✓ |  |
| Audit trail (Phase 3) | (toggle into Super Admin) | ✓ |  |
| Bulk import (Phase 4) | (toggle into Super Admin) | ✓ |  |
| Settings (Phase 4) | (toggle into Super Admin) | ✓ |  |

The role switcher in the top bar is the only entry point. OSD and Super Admin are the same person initially; the switcher just flips the surface. The capability is gated by `users.is_super_admin = true`.

---

## 5. Special rules

### 5.1 Personal visibility

- `visibility = 'personal'` makes the task visible to **exactly three sets of people, and no one else**: the **creator** (e.g. a Division Head or Super Admin who set it Personal and assigned it out), the **assigned owner**, and users **explicitly added as collaborators**. It is invisible to everyone else — other division members, and division heads / OSD / Super Admins who are none of the above — including in lists, dashboards, search, the calendar, and every task view.
- Enforced by the three base clauses in `buildVisibilityClausesFrom` (`ownerId` / `collaborators` / `createdById + visibility:'personal'`); every role clause is gated on `visibility:'division'`, so no role ever matches a Personal task. Dashboards (Command Centre, JS Dashboard) restrict their ministry-wide aggregates to `visibility:'division'` so a Personal task cannot leak into a count or list there either.
- Super Admin / OSD do **not** see others' Personal tasks in the regular lists — only via the audit trail (for compliance).
- The task appears in the **Personal Tasks** list of each eligible viewer. Subtasks inherit visibility from the parent task — a subtask cannot be more permissive than its parent.

### 5.2 PMU isolation

- A PMU is a sibling row in `divisions` with `kind = 'pmu'` and `pmu_parent_division_id` pointing to its supporting ministry division. PMU membership is `users.pmu_id`; everyone sharing a `pmu_id` is one PMU team.
- **A PMU team member sees their PMU team's tasks and nothing else of the division**: division-visibility tasks owned by anyone in their PMU (themselves + teammates), plus any task they own or are a collaborator on. They **never see the division board** — the internal ministry tasks are invisible to them.
- Enforced in the scoper (`buildVisibilityClausesFrom`, src/lib/visibility-rules.ts): the PMU branch emits an owner-scoped clause `{ visibility: 'division', ownerId: { in: <pmu member ids> } }` instead of the division-wide clause. Teammate ids come from `getPmuTeammateIds` (src/lib/visibility.ts). Personal tasks of teammates stay private (the clause is gated on `visibility: 'division'`).
- The reverse is permitted: ministry officers in a division see their PMU's tasks freely (the PMU members' tasks live in the division, so a division user's board already includes them).
- A PMU member holding an active delegation additionally sees the delegated division for the window, on top of their PMU team's tasks.
- On the `/tasks` board a PMU member's second segment is labelled "Other tasks of my PMU team" rather than "…of my division".
- **PMU team (entire) share**: the PMU's Team Leader can share a task they own with the whole PMU team. It sets `tasks.shared_with_pmu_team = true` (a PMU task only), and the scoper adds a **live** clause `{ visibility: 'division', shared_with_pmu_team: true, divisionId: <caller's pmu_id> }` — so every current member sees it, including anyone who joins the PMU later. Managed from the task's Collaborators section by the owning Team Leader (OSD / Super Admin may also toggle it); enforced server-side in `setPmuTeamShareAction`. A shared task is lifted into each member's **"Tasks assigned to me"** segment (`segmentTasksByRelation`, /tasks), and members are notified on enable. **Excluded: the PMU's home-division head** (`divisions.head_user_id` of `pmu_parent_division_id`) — they still see the task via the owner-scoped clause but it is not treated as a whole-team share for them (no share clause, not lifted into "assigned", no notification). The share is cleared automatically if the task's division changes away from the PMU.

### 5.3 Cross-division tasks

- Single **primary owner** (one person, the `tasks.owner_id`).
- One **division lead** per participating division, added via `task_collaborators.role = 'division_lead'`.
- The task appears in every participating division's list with a **"Primary: [Division Name]"** badge.
- All division leads notified at creation and at every status change.
- Division leads may comment and edit the task as collaborators; they cannot change ownership.
- **Participant scope (`src/lib/task-participants.ts`)**: collaborators, subtask assignees, and @mentions are drawn from — and validated against — the task's **participants**: the active **members** of the task's division (or, for a PMU task, its team), that division's **head**, and the oversight roles **OSD + Super Admin**. "Member of the task's division" means the division is the user's home division **or** they hold a `user_division_access` grant for it (§5.18) — resolved by a `{ divisionAccess: { some: { divisionId } } }` clause folded into the participant query, so an admin-granted member of the division counts as a participant everywhere. The seeded **Office of JS** division is the exception — its tasks may involve any active user. Because only oversight roles and the head otherwise cross division boundaries, adding a collaborator from an *unrelated* division is not possible for ordinary users; cross-division reach comes from shared membership (a user granted the task's division via `user_division_access`) or from OSD / Super Admin / the head. Every task user-picker and its server-side guard (`addCollaboratorAction`, `addSubtaskAction`, `updateSubtaskAction`, `resolveMentions`) call the same helper, so they never diverge. The task **owner** is deliberately stricter (same division only — set at creation).

### 5.4 OSD unrestricted access

- OSD sees everything across all divisions — the Command Centre.
- OSD can edit any task they can see (the only non-Super-Admin role with this power).
- OSD adds, removes, and reorders JS Priority lanes (exclusive control).
- OSD is the default creator of Timeline Files.

### 5.5 JS view

- JS's home is the JS Priority Board (Today + This Week visible by default; This Month + Watchlist via swipe).
- JS sees their own tasks plus everything on the Priority Board.
- JS does not see division-internal tasks unless they appear on the Priority Board or list them as owner/collaborator.

### 5.6 Reassignment

- **Who can reassign from the Owner row** — only **Super Admin, OSD, or the head of the task's division** (direct head or active delegate). The Owner row is read-only for everyone else, including the task's own owner and creator: a normal user changes ownership through **Transfer task** (below), not the Owner row. Enforced in `reassignTaskAction` (`mayInitiate`) and mirrored by `canReassign` on the task page.
- **Downward within own chain** — applies immediately. Log to `task_activity` and `audit_log`. No notification to the previous owner beyond the activity log entry.
- **Sideways or upward** — creates a `reassignment_requests` row with `approver_id` = the proposed new owner's superior. The superior receives a notification of type `reassignment_approval_requested`. On approval, the reassignment applies and a `reassignment_approved` notification fires to the requester; on rejection, `reassignment_rejected` fires.
- **Same-division transfer (by current owner)** — the task owner can transfer ownership to any active user in the same division without approval, and **must supply a comment** explaining the hand-off (the sheet offers one-tap reasons — "On leave", "This work belongs to another official", "Delegating it" — or free text). `ownerId` updates immediately; `createdById` stays unchanged. If the task had `personal` visibility, it flips to `division`. Activity log records `task_transferred` with `{from, to}`. The new owner receives `task_assigned`; the original creator (if different from both parties) receives `task_transferred`.
- The reassignment picker UI marks rows that would require approval with an amber "Approval needed" badge. The transfer button is separate — a prominent card visible only to the current task owner.
- **Assign / transfer across divisions flows from shared membership.** A division head (direct head or active delegate) may assign or transfer a task on a division they head to **any member of that division** — home members and users granted the division via `user_division_access` alike, since both are ordinary members of it (§5.18). The picker for a division's task therefore surfaces every member of that division, and an assignment to one of them is free (no approval). Cross-division reach (for example a user working across Khelo India and NSDF) is now expressed by granting that specific user the extra membership, not by a hardcoded division link.
  - **Retired.** The former **Cross-division allocation link (Khelo India → NSDF)** — `CROSS_DIVISION_ALLOCATION_LINKS = {KI:['NSDF']}` and `RbacActor.allocatableDivisionIds` in `src/lib/rbac` — has been **deleted from the code**. It automatically let any Khelo India head create / assign / transfer NSDF tasks. That blanket link no longer applies; a Super Admin instead grants the specific users who need cross-division reach an extra membership via `user_division_access`. (The migration seeds the named users into their extra memberships; see §5.18.)

### 5.7 Deletion and archive

The platform-wide task **Archive** (soft-delete) remains removed — there is no Archive/Restore action for **tasks** (the swipe-to-archive gesture is gone); the `archived_at` / `archived_by` columns and `archivedAt: null` read filters stay in the schema but nothing sets them for tasks.

**Timeline Files** have a **reversible archive** (soft-delete): OSD or a Super Admin may archive a file and later restore it (`archiveTimelineFileAction` / `unarchiveTimelineFileAction`, gated by `requireOsdOrSuperAdmin`). An archived file drops out of the active list, the summary counts, the calendar, and search; it appears only under the **"Archived TL files"** list toggle and on its (read-only) detail page, from which OSD/Super Admin can restore it. Archiving is visibility-neutral — it never changes who can see the file (`buildTfVisibilityClause` is unchanged). Archive/restore events are recorded in the audit trail.

| Condition | Available action | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Task — delete (hard) | **Delete** (removes the task, its subtasks, comments, collaborators, and attachments; cannot be undone) | The **head of the task's division** (direct head or active delegate) or a **Super Admin** (any task); plus a user for their **own personal task**. Enforced by `canActAsHeadOf` in `deleteTaskAction`. |
| Timeline File — archive / restore | **Archive** (reversible soft-delete) / **Restore** | OSD or Super Admin (`requireOsdOrSuperAdmin`) |
| Timeline File — hard-delete | **Delete** (permanent) | Super Admin only (any file, regardless of creator) |
| User | **Disable** (login blocked, audit history preserved) | Super Admin only |
| User — hard-delete |  | Not supported — would break the audit trail |

### 5.8 Status change on subordinate's task

- A superior can change the status of a subordinate's task that they can see.
- The change is logged to `task_activity` with the superior as the actor; the owner receives a `status_changed_on_my_task` notification.

### 5.9 @mention reach

- A user can `@`-mention only the task's **participants** (§5.3) — the division's members/head plus OSD/Super Admin (any user for Office of JS). The mention picker and the server-side `resolveMentions` both apply this rule, so an `@`-name outside the set silently does not resolve (no notification, no access grant).
- Mentioning a user automatically grants them read access to **this specific task** only, even if they would not otherwise see it. They appear as an implicit collaborator until removed.

### 5.10 Bootstrap account

- The first Super Admin account is created by the deployer (out-of-band).
- That account has `is_super_admin = true` and `hierarchy_slot = 'osd'`.
- No other Super Admin can exist until that account creates one and ticks the Super Admin Access toggle in the inspector.

### 5.11 Division-level task creation is a head power

- Only **Super Admin**, **OSD**, a division's **head** (`divisions.head_user_id`), or an **active delegate** (an unrevoked `division_access_delegations` row whose inclusive window covers now) may create a task with `division` visibility in that division. Enforced in `createTaskAction` via `canCreateDivisionTask` (src/lib/rbac/rules.ts).
- **Membership does not grant division-task creation.** Being a member of a division — home or admin-granted via `user_division_access` (§5.18) — lets a non-head see and work that division's board, but not create tasks on it. A non-head member still creates **personal** tasks only; creating a division task stays a head power. Head powers live on `headedDivisionIds`, never on the member set.
- Everyone else creates **personal** tasks only; the Quick Create sheet does not offer the Division option to them and defaults to Personal.
- The same rule gates **changing** a task's visibility in either direction (`updateTaskFieldsAction`) — an owner may not promote a personal task onto the division board, nor hide a division task.
- Spawning a task from a Timeline File always produces a division-level task, so the same rule applies there; the former "any viewer of the file" exception is removed.
- Subtasks still inherit the parent's visibility — an owner breaking down a head-given division task produces division-visible subtasks by design.
- Known residual path: a same-division ownership transfer of a `personal` task still auto-flips it to `division` (§5.6) so it does not vanish from the recipient's view.

### 5.12 JS Engagements (Office of JS meetings on the calendar)

The planning calendar (`/calendar`) shows three item kinds — **JS engagements** (teal), **task deadlines** (dark blue), and **Timeline file deadlines** (red). Tasks and Timeline files reuse their existing visibility scopers (`buildVisibilityClauses`, `buildTfVisibilityClause`), so a division user sees only their division's task deadlines and a PMU member only their team's (§5.2) — calendar and lists stay consistent.

JS Engagements are the Office of JS's own layer:

- **Seeing and managing engagements is limited to Office-of-JS members and Super Admins.** "Office-of-JS member" = `users.division_id` equals the seeded `Office of JS` division. Everyone else does not see engagements on the calendar at all, and cannot create or edit them.
- Both gates are the single predicate `canAccessEngagements` (src/lib/engagements.ts); the server actions (`createEngagementAction` / `updateEngagementAction` / `deleteEngagementAction` / `getEngagementDetail`) re-check it from the DB.
- Fields: title (required), date + start time (required; stored as one `starts_at` instant, IST wall-clock), venue or meeting link (optional), participants (existing active users), MoM notes, and optional attachment links. Attachments reuse the polymorphic `attachments` table (`owner_type = 'js_engagement'`).
- Every engagement is anchored to the Office of JS division, so the caller's own membership is the only visibility gate needed.
- From any date the calendar offers quick actions: **Add JS engagement** (managers only), **Create task** (opens Quick Create pre-dated), and **Create timeline file** (OSD / Super Admin). Clicking a task/TF opens its page; clicking an engagement opens its detail sheet with edit/delete for managers.

### 5.13 Working a task vs redefining it (owner ≠ editor)

Owning a task lets you **work** it, not **redefine** it. This matters after a transfer: the new owner is often a normal user, and simply becoming owner must not hand them control of the task's definition.

- **A normal user (even the owner) cannot**: delete the task, or edit its **name**, **due date**, **milestone**, or **recurrence**. These are gated by `canEditTaskDetails` / the delete guard — Super Admin, OSD, JS, a director of the division, or its head. (A user's **own personal task** stays fully theirs to edit and delete.)
- **The owner (and creator) can still**: change **status** and **priority**, edit the **description**, comment, and manage **subtasks** — including **reassigning a subtask** to someone else.
- **Subtask reassignment is logged with full detail**: `updateSubtaskAction` records a `subtask_updated` activity event carrying the subtask, the previous and new assignee (`fromName` / `toName`), and the actor; the activity log renders it as "‹actor› reassigned subtask ‹name› to ‹assignee› on ‹date, time›".
- Enforced on both sides: the task page hides the restricted controls (`canEditDetails`, `canDelete`), and the server actions (`updateTaskFieldsAction`, `deleteTaskAction`) re-check, so a stale client or direct call cannot bypass them.

### 5.14 New tasks start unassigned; division members pull them

A newly created **division** task has **no owner yet** — it is left owned by its creator, which the pull flow treats as "unassigned". The task is already visible to the whole division through the division-scoped visibility clause (§5.1), so any member can see it and **pull** it to take ownership. Creators do not name an owner up front.

- **Division task → starts unassigned.** The Owner row reads "Unassigned" until someone pulls it. Enforced in `createTaskAction` (the owner is left as the creator for `division`-visibility tasks).
- **PMU task → owner = that PMU's Team Leader** (the active user with `pmuRole = 'pmu_team_leader'` and `pmuId =` the PMU), falling back to the creator when unset. PMUs are the exception because PMU-team visibility is **owner-scoped** — a member sees tasks *owned by a teammate*, not a division board (§5.2) — so a PMU task must be owned by a PMU member to stay visible to the team. Resolved by `resolveDivisionOwner` (src/lib/rbac).
- **Personal task → owned by its creator** (unchanged; only the creator, the assigned owner, and collaborators ever see it — §5.11).
- **Pull (claim ownership).** Any active user who is a **member of the task's division** — its home members and users granted that division via `user_division_access` (§5.18) — may pull an unassigned, non-personal, top-level task and become its owner — `pullTaskAction`, surfaced as the **Pull task** button on the task detail page (shown when `ownerId === createdById`, the viewer is not already the owner, and the task is a non-personal top-level task in a division the viewer is a member of). Pulling logs a `task_pulled` activity event and notifies the creator.
- **Changing the Division/PMU later still reassigns ownership** to the new division's Head or the new PMU's Team Leader — `updateTaskFieldsAction` (when the Division/PMU changes) reassigns, logs an `owner_changed` activity event, and notifies the new owner. `resolveDivisionOwner` backs this path.
- The Division/PMU selector is populated from Structure & Hierarchy (divisions + their PMUs): the create form's picker (heads see divisions they head + those PMUs; OSD/Super Admin see all), the task-detail **Change division** control, and the `/tasks` division filter. Everything downstream — visibility, dashboards, filters, notifications — follows because it keys off the resulting `divisionId` / `ownerId`.

### 5.15 Collaborator contribution rights

Being an **explicit collaborator** on a task (any `task_collaborators` role — `collaborator`, `division_lead`, or `co_owner`) grants a bounded set of **contribute** rights, distinct from working or redefining the task (§5.13). A collaborator may:

- **Add documents** — upload files or paste Drive links on the task. Gated by `canAddTaskAttachments` (= `canEditTaskAttachments` OR collaborator), enforced in the presign route (`/api/attachments/upload-url`) and both register/drive-link actions. A collaborator can still delete or rename **only files they uploaded themselves** (the uploader check) — not another user's; managing others' files stays with `canEditTaskAttachments` (owner / creator / OSD / Super Admin).
- **Edit the context** — the task **description** only. Enforced in `updateTaskFieldsAction`: a collaborator-only editor whose submission touches any field other than `description` is rejected. Every other field (name, due date, visibility, recurrence, division, sub-division) keeps its existing, stricter gate.
- **Create subtasks** — `addSubtaskAction` now admits collaborators alongside owner / creator / head. This reverses the earlier "a collaborator cannot break a task down" restriction, by product decision; a subtask still inherits the parent's visibility, and the assignee must be a task participant (§5.3). A plain division member who merely *sees* the task (not a collaborator) still cannot add subtasks.

Contribute rights do **not** include changing status/priority, reassigning or completing existing subtasks, transferring/deleting the task, or editing its definition. The client mirrors each gate (`isCollaborator` on the task page drives the Context edit affordance, the subtask **Add** button via `canAdd`, and the attachment **Upload/Add link** buttons via `canAdd`).

### 5.16 Subtask lifecycle — delete and transfer

Subtasks are first-class tasks (`parent_task_id` set), so they reuse the task page and its actions, with two subtask-specific rules:

- **Delete** — a subtask may be deleted only by the **owner of the parent task**, the **head of the subtask's division** (direct or delegate), or a **Super Admin**. The subtask's own **assignee cannot delete it** — they were allotted the work, they do not own its lifecycle. There is no personal-owner self-delete path for subtasks (unlike top-level personal tasks). Enforced in `deleteTaskAction` (the `parentTaskId` branch) and mirrored by `canDelete` on the task page.
- **Transfer** — subtasks are transferable. The current owner (the assignee) hands the subtask to another user through the same **Transfer task** button, drawing from the same division-scoped dropdown as a top-level transfer (`fetchTransferTargets` → `canTransferTaskTo`: own division, division head(s), Super Admin) and requiring the same mandatory hand-off comment. Unlike a top-level personal task, a **personal subtask is not auto-promoted to `division`** on transfer — a subtask must never become more permissive than its parent (§5.1), so its visibility is left untouched.

### 5.17 Document at subtask creation

- **Cross-division participation is now expressed by membership, not a hardcoded link.** The former `CROSS_DIVISION_PARTICIPANT_LINKS` (the symmetric Khelo India / Khelo India Mission ↔ NSDF participant pairs, open to all members) has been **deleted from the code**. A user only participates in another division's tasks — as a collaborator, subtask assignee, or @mention — when a Super Admin has granted them that division via `user_division_access`, which makes them an ordinary member of it (§5.3, §5.18). There is no automatic all-members cross-division link any more.
- **Attach a document while creating a subtask.** The Add-subtask form offers an optional **document upload** (with an optional display name). The file is stored against the new subtask through the standard presign → PUT → register flow (`scope: 'task'`, `parentId` = the subtask id), so it reuses the same permission gate (`canAddTaskAttachments`) and storage path as any task attachment. The document's display name is surfaced **on the parent task's subtask panel** as a quick-view link (view route for uploads, raw URL for Drive links); full management (rename / delete / share / add more) stays on the subtask's own page. Requires object storage to be configured; when it is not, the upload control is disabled and the file can still be added from the subtask page.

### 5.18 Multi-division membership (admin-granted extra divisions)

A user has exactly **one home division** (`users.division_id`), which is unchanged and still drives ownership, display, PMU home, and reference-number identity. On top of that, a **Super Admin** can grant a user **extra divisions**, so a single user can be a full member of several divisions at once.

- **Where it is granted.** In **Super Admin → Users**, the create / edit user form carries an **Additional divisions** checkbox list. Ticking a division inserts a `user_division_access` row (§ DATA_MODEL.md); un-ticking removes it. The home division is not listed there — it is set by the ordinary Division field.
- **Member set.** A user's member set is `[home division_id, ...user_division_access divisions]`. It is resolved by `getMemberDivisionIds(userId)` / `getMemberDivisionsByUser()` (`src/lib/rbac/index.ts`) and carried on `RbacActor.memberDivisionIds` / `RbacTarget.memberDivisionIds` (`src/lib/rbac/rules.ts`). The visibility scopers union the member set — the officer / JS / PMU branches of `src/lib/visibility-rules.ts` for tasks, and the `markedTo` clause in `src/lib/timeline-files.ts` for Timeline Files — and participant checks add a `{ divisionAccess: { some: { divisionId } } }` clause in `src/lib/task-participants.ts`.
- **What membership grants (member-level access) in every member division:**
  - full board visibility of that division's **tasks** and its **Timeline Files**;
  - being a task **participant** — collaborator, subtask assignee, or @mention target (§5.3, §5.9);
  - being **assigned / transferred** a task, or **pulling** an unassigned division task (§5.6, §5.14);
  - **grouping the task list by division** across the member set;
  - and, for a **Director** who is a member, managing that division's tasks (the director clause in `canManageTask` / `canEditTaskDetails`).
- **What membership does NOT grant.** No head powers whatsoever — no delete, no delegation, no curation — and **no division-task creation** (§5.11): a non-head member still creates personal tasks only. Head powers stay strictly on `headedDivisionIds` and are never widened by a membership grant.
- **Replaces the retired hardcoded links.** Cross-division collaboration that used to be wired in code — `CROSS_DIVISION_ALLOCATION_LINKS` (Khelo India → NSDF allocation, §5.6), `CROSS_DIVISION_PARTICIPANT_LINKS` (KI / KIM ↔ NSDF participation, §5.17), and the per-username `CROSS_DIVISION_VIEW_GRANTS`, along with `getAllocatableDivisionIds`, `getLinkedParticipantDivisionIds`, `linkedParticipantAbbreviations`, and `RbacActor.allocatableDivisionIds` — is **removed**. The Super Admin now grants the specific users who need such reach an extra membership instead. This is a **behaviour change**: the old blanket KI/KIM ↔ NSDF links no longer apply automatically, so the specific users are re-granted per user. The migration seeds the two named users **yogesh** and **vaishali** into **SGM** and **Autonomous Bodies** memberships.
