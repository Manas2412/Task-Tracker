 * Who may take part in a task — the single source of truth for every task

 * server-side guard, so the pickers and the actions never diverge.
 *
 * A task's participants are the active MEMBERS of its division — users whose
 * home division is the task's division OR who hold an admin-granted extra
 * membership in it (user_division_access) — or, for a PMU task, its PMU team,
 * plus that division's head and the always-relevant oversight roles (OSD +
 * Super Admin). The seeded "Office of JS" division is a coordinating office, so
 * its tasks may involve any active user.
 *
 * Cross-division participation is therefore expressed by membership: a user
 * homed elsewhere but granted the task's division as an extra member counts as
 * a participant exactly like a home member. This replaces the retired hardcoded
 * cross-division participant links (KI / KIM ↔ NSDF). See PERMISSIONS §5.17.
 *
 * The task OWNER is deliberately stricter (same division only — see
 * createTaskAction) and is not built from this rule.
